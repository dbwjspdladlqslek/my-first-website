    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
